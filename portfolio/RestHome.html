        <p>PB's Restaurant is the place to be for a taste of classic Americana. <br />
           We have been serving up delicious dishes to our valued customers since 1952. <br />
           Started by our founder PB as a way to serve the less fortunate, <br />
           our mission is to provide warm, hearty meals to anyone who walks through our doors.<br />
           We also provide catering services or bring the fun to us and host a private party.<br />
           So stop on by, and relax at place that feels like home, here at PB's Restaurant.</p>
